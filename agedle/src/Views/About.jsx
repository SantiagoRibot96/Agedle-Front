        <p>This site is inspired by the countless wordle-like games online. In this case, it is an Age of Empires II: DE gamedle.</p>
        <p>As a fan of the series, I've spent many hours watching AoE2 streamings. Some creators, such as NachoAoE, Tatoh, Viper, and Hera, have taught me a lot about the game.</p>
        <p>This game was born as a small project for Opinologia (@avanzadaopinologia on YouTube) during a special broadcast about Age of Empires.</p>
